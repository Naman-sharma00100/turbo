# About Turbo

Turbo is a forward-thinking web application framework that prioritizes speed and efficiency without the need for extensive JavaScript development. It provides a suite of powerful tools that work in harmony:


*  **Turbo Drive**: Redefining navigation and form submissions, Turbo Drive ensures a seamless user experience by bypassing full page reloads. This allows for swift, uninterrupted interactions.

* **Turbo Frames**: By disassembling pages into self-contained modules, Turbo Frames introduces isolated contexts that facilitate efficient navigation and support lazy loading. This empowers developers to create responsive, high-performance applications.

* **Turbo Streams**: Leveraging WebSockets or form submissions, Turbo Streams enables dynamic page updates. Through intuitive CRUD-like actions and straightforward HTML markup, developers can effortlessly implement real-time changes.

* **Turbo Native**: Elevate your application to serve as the core of native iOS and Android apps. Turbo Native seamlessly integrates web and native sections, offering users a cohesive and engaging experience.

By transmitting HTML directly over the wire, Turbo achieves its seamless performance. In cases where additional capabilities are needed, one can seamlessly transition to the complementary features of Hotwire, and further enhance functionality with the dynamic capabilities of [Stimulus](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus).
